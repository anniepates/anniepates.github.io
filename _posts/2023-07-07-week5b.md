title: Week 5.5
---

This was a short week with the holiday and other commitments, but I really feel like I have a much better handle on the scope of my project with just these few days. I was able to adjust my NLP methodology on the scraped descriptions to identify important common words. Next, I will need to run the same sort of overlap analysis on the 3D meshes I downloaded last week so that I can match overlapping keywords to overlapping emsh segments. Then I will feed this graph into an unsupervised learning algorithm that will eventually be able to predict a text label for a mesh segment or vice versa. This still seems like quite a daunting task at this point, but I will be very happy to have these skills & understanding once I'm done. I'm very lucky to have the support of Prof. Hofmann and Faraz guiding me through each step. Hopefully with this clarity, next week I will be able to make large strides in getting this done!

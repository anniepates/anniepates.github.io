title: Week 1

I am very excited to begin this project! I spent the first week getting to know Prof. Hofmann and her work. We spoke about several domains her lab is working on, and determined which open areas are most suited to my experience and interests. Professor Hofmann and MIT PhD student Faraz Faruqi are working on a model to use generative AI to create 3-D printable models that remain functional. Based on my past industry experience doing content coding of qualitative surveys, I will work on integrating machine learning methods of classifying objects users may want to create to replace the hand-classification upfront work that Prof. Hoffman and Faraz did in their research. 
To prepare for this work, I began by reading Prof. Hofmann's ongoing research as well as "Text2Mesh: Text-Driven Neural Stylization for Meshes" (Michel et al 2022) which discusses styling a 3D mesh from a text prompt by predicting color and local geometric details. I also had the opportunity to explore the codebases for Prof. Hofmann's optimizer research and Faraz's work in progress. It was a great experience to work through someone else's code and learn how to contribute to an existing project rather than the bottom-up projects that form the bulk of my coursework. Finally, I got a taste of what sort of tools we work with by playing around with the Point-e and Shap-e tools from OpenAI to create 3D images and meshes from 2-D images and text prompts.

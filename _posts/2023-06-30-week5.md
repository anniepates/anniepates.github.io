This week, I focused on getting more data I can use to test my NLP algorithm. Faraz's work already includes a Selenium web scraper, so I worked on adjusting it to my purposes. After setting up the necessary repositories on my machine, I examined the Thingyverse HTML to adjust the download button id's necessary to make Faraz's code run. Then I tweaked it so that rather than searching for all the most popular objects, it searches for a few of the relevant keywords identified in earlier weeks like "pill box" and "earplugs". 

This did a great job downloading the necessary mesh files for the top matches on each keyword. This will be important so that we can segment them and look for similar segments. But I also needed to scrape the object titles and descriptions to run through the NLP methodology and find overlapping words to match with overlapping segments. This required me to dive more into the Selenium methodology and better understand the Thingyverse HTML to understand how the parts I wanted to scrape were labeled. I was able to run the results of my scrape through my NLP algorithm and found that it was still able to isolate the predetermined keywords as well as point to the important parts of speech.

This was my first time actually working with a web scraper, and I really enjoyed getting to see how it operated.

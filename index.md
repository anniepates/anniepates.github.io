## About Me

Hi! My name is Annie, and I am pursuing a master's in computer science in the Align program at Northeastern University in Boston. Prior to my CS studies, I worked for several years at a research consulting firm where I did everything from survey design to data analysis to project and team management. My coursework so far has focused on AI and software engineering, especially around creating software systems that interact with data repositories. Outside of school, I love hiking, baking, and sailing.

I am very excited to spend this summer as a DREAM research fellow. The Distributed REsearch Apprenticeships for Masterâ€™s, is an NSF-funded research program designed to support students entering the field of computer science without CS backgrounds by offering mentorship, professional development, and collaboration in pursuit of higher education.

## About My Advisor

I am advised by <a href="https://www.megan-hofmann.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Prof. Megan Hofmann</a>, director of the <a href="https://actlab.sites.northeastern.edu/research/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Accessible Technologies Lab</a> at Northeastern.

I am also colloaborating with <a href="https://www.farazfaruqi.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Faraz Faruqi</a>, PhD student at MIT CSAIL.

## About My Project

The larger research project I am joining focuses on segmenting 3D models to allow for personalization without sacrificing the functionality of the object once fabricated for use in the real world. My work involves using natural language processing to identify important features in model descriptions. The goal is to match overlapping keywords in object descriptions with overlapping segments in the 3D meshes to identify related objects that may not be adequately labeled. This will allow user queries to find a better range of potential models. I am very excited to join in the accessibility focus of Prof. Hofmann's lab- I will also be including models from the NIH 3D database to enable fabrication of assitive devices.
